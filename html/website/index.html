    <h1 class="hed1" id="hed">Indian Premier League</h1>
    <p class="par1" id="par">The Indian Premier League is a professional men's Twenty20 cricket league, contested by ten teams based out of ten Indian cities. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India in 2007</p>

            <p class="hed2" id="head3" >On its twelfth day of release, S.S. Rajamouli’s RRR topped Rs. 900 crores worldwide, becoming the fourth Indian movie to do so. With a gross of Rs. 913 crores approx through Tuesday, RRR outstripped 2015 release Bajrangi Bhaijaan, becoming the third-biggest grossing Indian movie of all time globally. The top two movies are Dangal and Baahubali: The Conclusion and it’s unlikely that RRR will ever catch up to those films. Though if one considers only traditional markets, excluding China, RRR is only behind Baahubali 2 as Dangal did the bulk of its business from the Middle Kingdom.

 
                    The domestic and overseas split for RRR as of yesterday is Rs. 726 crores and Rs. 187 crores ($24.50 million). It will add another Rs. 200 crores or so in India and Rs. 20 crores overseas for a final business somewhere around Rs. 1125-1150 crores. There will be a Japan release sometime later in the year and Rajamouli has made some niche there with Baahubali movies, so that will add to the total. A China release may be there as well, though not much will be expected since even Baahubali 2 didn’t do much but may give the film bragging rights to Rs. 1200 crores worldwide number.
 
                        The all-time top ten highest-grossing Indian movies worldwide are as follows:
 
                            Dangal - Rs. 2008.30 crores
                            Baahubali: The Conclusion - Rs. 1754.50 crores
                            RRR - Rs. 913 crores approx (12 days)
                            Bajrangi Bhaijaan - Rs. 902.80 crores
                            Secret Superstar - Rs. 895.50 crores
                            PK - Rs. 762 crores
                            2.0 - Rs. 666.30 crores
                            Sultan - Rs. 616.60 crores
                            Sanju - Rs. 588.30 crores
                            Baahubali: The Beginning - Rs. 581 crores</p>

Rajamouli’s RRR topped Rs. 900 crores worldwide, becoming the fourth Indian movie to do so. With a gross of Rs. 913 crores approx through Tuesday, RRR outstripped 2015 release Bajrangi Bhaijaan, becoming the third-biggest grossing Indian movie of all time globally. The top two movies are Dangal and Baahubali: The Conclusion and it’s unlikely that RRR will ever catch up to those films. Though if one considers only traditional markets, excluding China, RRR is only behind Baahubali 2 as Dangal did the bulk of its business from the Middle Kingdom.

It will add another Rs. 200 crores or so in India and Rs. 20 crores overseas for a final business somewhere around Rs. 1125-1150 crores. There will be a Japan release sometime later in the year and Rajamouli has made some niche there with Baahubali movies, so that will add to the total. A China release may be there as well, though not much will be expected since even Baahubali 2 didn’t do much but may give the film bragging rights to Rs. 1200 crores worldwide number.
